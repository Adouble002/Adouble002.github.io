        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p class="font">My career goals are just to be something meaningful for myself. My mom is probably the most wise person I know. People always say work hard but my mom says instead of not only work hard but to work smart so you do not have to work so hard. People are always saying be something ordinary like doctor or a dentist or a lawyer. I have never found intrest in those jobs. My uncle is actually a website programer and him and his company created the website for the Girl Scouts of America and the Royal Caribbean Cruise. Also my dad is a really successful buisness man. He initially went to school planning on runnign something like a hotel but ended up starting a really successful auto body buisness, I-10 Collision Center. So I really look up to my dad mostly and my uncle for inspiration on my career.</p>
        <h3>Abilities and Skills</h3>
            <p class="font">I have many abilities and skills. Some of those vary from sports, academically, cars, and even starting to cook. For sports, I have played and are currently playing Baseball, Mountain Biking, Football, Golf, Tenis, Surfing, and Soccer. For academically wise I maintained a 4.0 GPA all through middle schoo, gotten student of the month all through middle school, I have done robotics, BotBall, for 2 years, and engineering my 8th grade year. I have been really into cars lately. Since my dad owns a Auto Body buisness he has given me a chance to start getting in the habit of making my own money but also to learn about cars. He says that if I even just learn the basics of a car I can always find a job because cars is a modern necessity in life.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="font">In conclusion, I have many attributes to my life and very high career goals. I just want to do something good for the world in all of this negativity. I has been hard because of COVID-19, but we also need to just persevere through this and push through these hard times and move foward.</p>
